# DSA

Learnt from Namaste DSA

algorithm - the solution we write to solve a problem is algorithm.<br>
Sorted increasing order - [1,2,3,4] <br>
Sorted decreasing order - [4,3,2,1] <br>
Sorted non decreasing order - measns it has duplicates - [1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4] <br>
in place - means modify the same array <br>
NOTE - executing 'for of' loop takes more time as compared to simple for loop <br>
NOTE - any result output array is not considered for space complexity if it is not included in our login implementation. And is used just to store the output (as demanded by the question).
