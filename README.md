# DSA

Learnt from Namaste DSA

1. algorithm - the solution we write to solve a problem is algorithm.<br>
2. Sorted increasing order - [1,2,3,4] <br>
3. Sorted decreasing order - [4,3,2,1] <br>
4. Sorted non decreasing order - measns it has duplicates - [1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4] <br>
5. in place - means modify the same array <br>
6. <b>NOTE</b> - executing 'for of' loop takes more time as compared to simple for loop <br>
7. <b>NOTE</b> - any result output array is not considered for space complexity if it is not included in our login implementation. And is used just to store the output (as demanded by the question).
8. <b>Set/Hash set</b>- An unordered collection of unique elements. However, it's availability as a built in data structure can vary based on programming language. Eg - Python(set), Java(Set), C++(std::set), JS(Set), C#(HashSet<T>) <br>
<b>Searching, adding and deleting in a set is very quick. In O(1), due to underlyinh hash table implementation</b> <br>
Adding a value to set - .add() <br>
Assessing availability of a set - .has <br>
Deleting a value in set - .delete <br>
Eg - Jewels and Stones problem uses set
9. '.includes' has a time complexity of O(n)
10. Strings can have only limited characters and maybe some special characters. That is why we can use sets, maps very frequently for string problems.
11. <b>Hash map</b>- A data structure that stores unique key-value pair and uses a hash function to enable fast retrieval, insertion and eletion. In O(1). Eg - Python(dict), Java(HashMap), C++(std::unordered_map), JS(Map)
